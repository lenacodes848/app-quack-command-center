### Phase 0 discovery and TASK_001

Environment discovery (read only): macOS 15.7.9 arm64, zsh, default Node 22.21.1, Claude Code 2.1.282 logged in through a claude.ai subscription, tmux present, git present. Codex, Hermes, cloudflared and gitleaks were not installed.

Actions:
- Installed Node 24.21.0 LTS through nvm and gitleaks 8.30.1 through Homebrew.
- Checked registry versions against the PRD pins. TypeScript and Vitest have new majors, so the PRD pins are kept until Task 002 tests the set together. Details in `research.md`.
- Verified better-sqlite3 13.0.3 on Node 24 arm64 in a throwaway directory: prebuilt install, SQLite 3.53.4, FTS5 match, WAL, `backup()`.
- Owner decisions recorded in `STUDENT_DECISIONS.md`: Claude Code first, second provider at the Phase 6 gate, local first with Cloudflare in Phase 6, device pairing authentication, tmux compatibility mode kept in scope until the Phase 7 gate, orchestration and review loop excluded, name Quack Command Center, amber, duck emoji, allowed root ~/Downloads/1-git for now.
- Created the four memory files, `.nvmrc`, `.gitignore`, a minimal `package.json`, the source protection scanner, and a secrets scanning workflow.

Tests (Node's built in runner, since Vitest arrives in Task 002):
- Red first: the suites failed because the scanner module and the project files did not exist.
- Failure recorded: `node --test tests/repo/` with a directory argument fails on Node 24. The glob form works.
- Green: `npm run test:repo` passes. `npm run scan:source` passes. `npm run scan:secrets` finds no leaks in the working tree.

Result: TASK_001 acceptance criteria 1 to 6 and test requirements 1 to 3 are met. Open items for the owner are listed in `discovery.md`.

### Correction after PR review (same day)

The entry above said the gitleaks scan was clean. That was the local `npm run scan:secrets` only. The first CI run on the pull request failed: `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` returned HTTP 403 because the workflow's `permissions: contents: read` block dropped the `pull-requests` scope the action needs on `pull_request` events. The push run passed only because that code path never calls the pull request API, so it was not evidence that PR scanning worked. TASK_001 test requirement 3 (a secrets scanner runs in CI) was therefore not yet true when it was ticked.

Fix, test first: four new tests in `tests/repo/repo-structure.test.mjs` failed against the old workflow (permissions scope, PR comments, npm script names, push trigger), then passed after the change. The workflow now grants `contents: read` and `pull-requests: read`, disables gitleaks PR comments (`GITLEAKS_ENABLE_COMMENTS: "false"`, so no write scope is needed), calls `npm run test:repo` and `npm run scan:source` by name, and runs on `push` to `main` only. `npm run test:repo` is 28 of 28 locally. CI on the pull request is the evidence for requirement 3 and is recorded below once it is green.

CI evidence: after the fix, the `scan` job on the pull request passed in 9 seconds (workflow run 36080015555). Repository tests, the source protection scan and gitleaks all ran on the `pull_request` event, which is the path that failed before. TASK_001 test requirement 3 is now backed by CI.

Not done, deferred to TASK_003 (CI and validation commands): full-tree and full-history gitleaks in CI so a merge to `main` is scanned, and pinning third party actions to commit SHAs.

### Handoff written (same day, after the Phase 0 pull requests merged)

Both Phase 0 pull requests were merged. CI on `main` succeeded and `npm run test:repo` passed 28 of 28 there. `HANDOFF.md` was written for the next coding agent: state, decisions, environment, working method, owner gates, ordered next steps, gotchas and open items. `plan.md` now shows TASK_002 as unblocked.

Tests, written first: three new checks in `tests/repo/repo-structure.test.mjs` (HANDOFF.md exists with the required sections, names the task `plan.md` says is current, and links only to files that exist). They failed before the document existed. After writing it, two checks failed for real reasons: the source protection scan flagged a literal SSH-style git remote quoted in the document (the known email-rule false positive), and the link check flagged a kit file that is deliberately not in this repository. Both were fixed by rewording the document, not by loosening a rule or a test. `npm run test:repo` is 31 of 31, `npm run scan:source` and `npm run scan:secrets` are clean locally. CI on the handoff pull request is the evidence for the workflow, recorded when it runs.

Finding recorded for TASK_003: branch protection is unavailable on this private repository's plan (the API returns HTTP 403), so "CI blocks merging" needs an owner decision.

CI evidence for the handoff pull request: the `scan` job passed in 12 seconds (workflow run 36082314683) on the `pull_request` event, covering the repository tests, the source protection scan and gitleaks.

## 2026-09-24 (Phase 1)

### TASK_002 Monorepo scaffold and pinned toolchain

Branch `phase-1/foundation`, stacked on the handoff pull request. Detailed plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-task-002-monorepo-scaffold.md`.

Before planning, a toolchain compatibility spike (two scratch projects, results in `research.md`) settled the versions: the PRD pins work together and TypeScript stays on 6.0.2 because typescript-eslint does not support 7. Then, test first, one task at a time:
- Workspace skeleton and toolchain config, with a smoke test. Red: the test failed on the missing module. Green after adding the source.
- Environment schema (`@quack/config`). Red: module missing. Green: 9 tests. Mutation check: allowing `0.0.0.0` failed 2 tests.
- Secret guard for `VITE_` variables. Red, then green. Mutation check: disabling the pattern failed 7 tests.
- Server entry point. Built output exits 1 with an actionable message on a bad environment and starts on loopback with a good one.
- Web scaffold (React, Tailwind, Vite). Build worked at once but type-check failed on duplicate Vite copies. Fixed with a root override, see `research.md`.
- Integration tests: a canary server-only variable never reaches the web bundle, and a secret-looking `VITE_` variable fails the build without printing its value. Mutation checks: leaking the canary through `define` failed the canary test only, and removing the guard call failed the guard test only.

Findings recorded as data:
- `npm audit` reported an advisory in Vitest 4.1.10, the PRD pin. Moved to 4.1.11, audit reports 0 vulnerabilities. Deviation recorded in `research.md`.
- Two `tsc -b` and lint setup slips: the type-check script named `apps/web` before it existed, and package tsconfigs exclude tests so ESLint needed its own `tsconfig.eslint.json`. `tsbuildinfo` files needed a `.gitignore` entry.
- Prettier is scoped to code and config (`*.md` ignored). It reformatted the Phase 0 scripts and workflow, and one repo test had to accept single or double quotes.

Evidence (all local, run after the last commit):
- Clean clone of the branch: `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (24 tests in 5 files), `npm run build` all exit 0.
- In the repository: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run build`, `npm audit` (0 vulnerabilities) all pass. `npm test` 24 of 24, `npm run test:repo` 31 of 31, `npm run scan:source` and `npm run scan:secrets` clean.

Result: TASK_002 acceptance criteria 1 to 7 and test requirements 1 to 4 are met locally. CI evidence for the pull request is recorded below once the run finishes.


CI evidence for the TASK_002 pull request: the `scan` job passed in 9 seconds (workflow run 36083979890) on the `pull_request` event. That run covers only the repository tests, the source protection scan and gitleaks. It does not run `npm ci`, type-check, lint, Vitest or the builds, so it is not evidence for the TASK_002 code. That evidence is the local and clean-clone runs above. CI for the toolchain arrives with TASK_003.

### Handoff abandoned, knowledge folded in (same day)

The owner decided not to hand the build to another agent, so the handoff pull request (#8) was closed unmerged and `HANDOFF.md` is not part of the repository. The durable parts of it moved to where the project memory belongs: the owner gates and open items are now sections of `plan.md`, and the environment notes, the branch protection finding, the deferred CI hardening and the scanner rule gaps are sections of `research.md`. Earlier entries in this file that mention the handoff document are history and are left as written.

Test first: the three handoff tests were replaced by three tests requiring those sections and forbidding any stale reference to a handoff document. They failed against the old files (3 failures), then passed after the move. `npm run test:repo` is 31 of 31.

## 2026-09-24 (bug fixes from the issue tracker, pull request 2)

### CI gitleaks (#3)

Reproduced from the CI logs of the pushes to `main` for the merges of pull requests 2 and 9: `0 commits scanned`, then a green "No leaks detected". Root cause confirmed: the action's push range is `--no-merges --first-parent`, which is empty after a merge-commit merge. Owner decisions: replace the action with a pinned CLI, and prove failure on a throwaway branch.

Design: install gitleaks 8.30.1 in CI with its SHA-256 verified (checksum from the official release, matched against my own download), scan the full tree with `npm run scan:secrets` and the full history with a new `npm run scan:secrets:history`. The history script parses gitleaks' own "N commits scanned" line and fails on zero, which also covers an empty repository (gitleaks prints "0 commits scanned" and exits 0 there). Dropping the action also removes the `pull-requests: read` scope, so the token is `contents: read` only.

Test first: workflow-shape tests in `tests/repo/repo-structure.test.mjs` and a new `tests/repo/scan-history.test.mjs` that runs the real gitleaks against temporary repositories. Red: 3 workflow tests failed and the script module was missing. One new test passed vacuously (install-before-tests order, because a missing step compares as -1), so it was tightened to require both steps. Green: `npm run test:repo` 40 of 40. Those tests need gitleaks, so locally they skip without it and in CI (`CI` set) a missing gitleaks fails them. Mutation checks: dropping the zero guard failed the zero-commits test, swallowing gitleaks' exit code failed the leak test, and restoring the action failed the no-action test.

Backfill: `gitleaks git` over the full local history scanned 19 commits with no leaks (20 once this branch's first commit is included), and the full-tree scan is clean. That covers the earlier specification commit that CI never scanned.

Slip recorded as data: my first docs commit on this branch was pushed incomplete. A script edited `research.md` and then failed on a `plan.md` anchor that differs on this branch, and my shell command chain went on to commit and push anyway. This entry and the `plan.md` change landed in the next commit. Lesson: run multi-file edit scripts inside a `&&` chain so a failure stops the commit.


Real-CI evidence for issue 3, recorded on the pull request run and a throwaway branch:
- The passing run on this branch (workflow run 36089706173) verified the gitleaks checksum (`OK`), scanned the working tree (~322 KB, no leaks) and scanned **22 commits** of history (no leaks). It ran the repo tests too, including the ones that call the real gitleaks.
- A throwaway pull request with one fake credential-shaped value made CI fail (workflow run 36089769556): the `Secrets scan (full working tree)` step reported `leaks found: 1` and the history step was skipped. That pull request was closed and its branch deleted, and no remote branch remains.
- Still to check after merge: the push-to-`main` run must report more than zero commits scanned. That check is recorded when the pull request is merged.
